# Used Vehicle Trim and Listing Price Prediction
## Problem Statement
Included in these materials please find two comma separated values (.csv) files: Training_dataset.csv and 
Test_dataset.csv
Included in the training dataset is information on used cars previously sold. Each row corresponds to one used car listing. 
The first column of the data contains a unique identifier for the listing. The next twenty-six columns contain information 
on parameters relevant to the transaction, with those parameters described in more detail in the appendix attached. 
Finally, the last two columns of the “Training_dataset.csv” contain information on “Vehicle_Trim” and 
“Dealer_Listing_Price”, which describe the trim of the vehicle involved in the sale, and the price at which the vehicle was 
listed by the dealer.
Your challenge is to build one or more models, through whatever means you find most appropriate, capable of predicting 
vehicle trim and dealer listing price given the other twenty six variables provided.
